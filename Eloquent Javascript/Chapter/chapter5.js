/**
 * Deep comparison
The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes youâ€™d prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.

To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the === operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".

The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.

 /**
  * Everything
Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array. In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is like the && operator.

Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.

function every(array, test) {
  // Your code here.
}

  /**
   * Dominant writing direction
Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string of text. Remember that each script object has a direction property that can be "ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or "ttb" (top to bottom).

The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that have a script associated with them. The characterScript and countBy functions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful here.
